# Langchain-Vector-Store

This repository offers a comprehensive guide to utilizing vector stores in LangChain, with a focus on ChromaDB. It encompasses code examples, explanatory notes, and a video tutorial to facilitate understanding and implementation.

## ðŸ§  Overview

Vector stores are specialized databases designed to store and retrieve high-dimensional vector embeddings. In the context of LangChain, they enable efficient semantic search and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by:

1. **Embedding Documents**: Transforming textual data into vector representations using embedding models.
2. **Storing Embeddings**: Persisting these vectors in a vector store like ChromaDB.
3. **Querying**: Retrieving relevant documents based on vector similarity to a query.

This approach allows for more nuanced and context-aware information retrieval compared to traditional keyword-based searches.

For a detailed explanation of these loaders, refer to the [**Notes Vector Stores in LangChain.pdf**](https://github.com/Harsh-Jindal-web/Langchain-Text-Splitters/blob/main/Notes%20Text%20Splitters%20in%20LangChain.pdf) available in this repository.
